# NPC Thought Starter Generator
 
A D&D NPC Generator created by tiktok user @ezfii. 

This generator is made under the assumption that it knows nothing about your game or world, and that you already know what you need an NPC for. It aims to inspire a character rather than create a complete one. This way, you can interpret the results however you want to more easily integrate the NPC into your story and add your own creative flair. 

## How to Use

This generator works best if you know what role you need this NPC to play. For example, it might be a character's mother, a local tavern keeper, or a minion of the big bad evil guy. 

You can toggle generators on and off using the options at the bottom of the page. The default set should work for most NPCs. You can also change settings for the generators you have selected to make the results work better for your game's world and your preferences. (Presets are coming in a future release.)

Click on the Generate button to generate an NPC. If there are individual results you don't like, you can click on the d20 icon next to it to reroll that one aspect without affecting the rest of the character.

When you're happy with the NPC generated, you can click on Export Text to see results in a format that's easy to copy and paste into the notetaking app of your choice.
